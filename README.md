# ChainLog

**ChainLog** is a decentralized, tamper-proof logging and audit system. It provides an immutable public record for any application that needs verifiable, timestamped data history where trust is distributed.

---

## 1. BLOCKCHAIN BASICS

- **Blocks**: Data containers that get chained together
- **Mining**: Process to add new blocks to the chain  
- **Nodes**: Computers that run the network
- **Consensus**: All nodes agree on the same data

## 2. DATA STORAGE

- Store any information: messages, files, records
- Timestamped and ordered
- Immutable - can't be changed once added
- Transparent - everyone can see it

## 3. NETWORK

- **P2P**: Computers connect directly to each other
- **Broadcast**: New data gets sent to all nodes
- **Validation**: Nodes verify data is valid  
- **Sync**: All nodes stay updated

## 4. SECURITY

- **Cryptography**: Data is cryptographically signed
- **Proof-of-Work**: Mining prevents spam/attacks
- **Digital Signatures**: Prove who created data
- **Hashing**: Link blocks together securely

## 5. WALLET & IDENTITY

- **Key Pairs**: Public/private keys for each user
- **Addresses**: Unique IDs derived from public keys
- **Signing**: Users sign their transactions
- **Verification**: Anyone can verify signatures

## 6. TRANSACTIONS

- **Data Payload**: The actual information being stored
- **Sender**: Who created it
- **Signature**: Proof it's authentic
- **Timestamp**: When it was created

## 7. MINING

- **Proof-of-Work**: Solve math problem to add block
- **Difficulty**: Adjusts to keep block time consistent
- **Reward**: Motivation for miners (could be reputation)
- **Competition**: Miners race to find next block

# 8. COINS AND ECONOMY

ChainLog uses **LogCoins** as a utility token to secure the network and incentivize participation.

## How LogCoins Work

**Mining Rewards**
* Miners earn **10 LogCoins** for each valid block mined
* Rewards compensate miners for computational work
* Ensures blocks are produced consistently

**Transaction Fees**
* Users pay **1-5 LogCoins** to store data on-chain
* Fees prevent network spam and abuse
* Priority processing for higher fee transactions

**Staking System**
* Stake **100+ LogCoins** to become a validator
* Validators participate in consensus and governance
* Malicious behavior results in stake slashing

**Governance**
* LogCoin holders vote on protocol upgrades
* Voting power proportional to coin balance
* Community-driven development decisions

## Practical Benefits

**For Users:**
* Pay coins to store important data permanently
* Higher fees = faster confirmation times
* Build reputation through coin ownership

**For Miners:**
* Earn coins for securing the network
* Transaction fees provide additional income
* Compete to solve blocks and earn rewards

**For the Network:**
* Coins prevent Sybil attacks and spam
* Incentivizes decentralized participation
* Self-sustaining economic model

## Economic Model

**Supply & Distribution**
* Initial supply: **1,000,000 LogCoins** (genesis block)
* Block reward halving every **100,000 blocks** (~2 years)
* Maximum supply cap: **21,000,000 LogCoins**
* Circulating supply increases gradually through mining

**Deflationary Mechanisms**
* Transaction fees are partially burned (20%)
* Reduces total supply over time
* Creates scarcity as network usage grows

**Use Cases Beyond Fees**
* Data storage pricing in LogCoins
* Premium features (priority timestamps, batch uploads)
* Network service subscriptions
* Third-party integrations and APIs

This economic structure ensures ChainLog remains secure, decentralized, and sustainable while aligning incentives across all network participants.

Instead of moving money, ChainLog moves **trust** - providing cryptographic proof that data existed at a certain time and hasn't been modified since and it happens right in your terminal.
